<h1>my personal connections...</h1>

<img src="green.jpg" height="400"/>

<p>The game fortnite always is my favourite game. it had my favourite style, animal, and friends to play around with! i begain fortnite the first day it came out and was playing it all the way now! i really enjoyed it and made lots of memories wiht frineds that are now in a different school. when i begain taking it abit more seriously, i got myself a PC wiht my money and tried out for a tournament last summer! i turned out winning 500$ off of it. but when my parents knew they were abit edgy about it. thry think that if i can earn money from that then i can do it as a job. But my dream isn't a pro fortnite player. i want to be a scientist and gaming is just a small part of my life, so imma just keep it that way.</p>

<h3>my own highlights:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Won some money from the world cup sitting st home...</li>
  <li>I stayed for the best mobile player on fortnite for a day!</li>
  <li>i emailed fortnite to make a skin for ninja and after a year or so they email back telling me that they are working on onr for NINJA and thanked me for my reccomendation! (it was also ceccomended by alot more people... i was just one of them.)</li>

<h1>my signature skin...(the skin that i always use...)</h1>
